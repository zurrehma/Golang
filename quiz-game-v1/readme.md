This is the version 1 of quiz game, so far the program reads the csv file which contains questions and answers, present it to the user and match the user answer to question answer present inside csv. It also includes timer for quiz whenever the time is exceeded the quiz will stop. The problem so far is that the quiz accepts the answer from user even if time is finished, this is because the Scanf which is reading user input is blocking code so until user doesn't provide any answer the code will be stuck. To resolve this issue we will introduce non-blocking code by using go routines in second version.
